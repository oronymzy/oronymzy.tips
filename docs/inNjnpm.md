# installing [Node.js] and [npm]

!!! attention
    
    The newest version of Node.js may not be supported. If this is the case, older releases can be tried until a compatible version is found.

In Ubuntu, use:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## prior work
The installation script was introduced to me by [the Debian and Ubuntu based distrubitions installation instructions at the NodeSource Node.js Binary Distributions GitHub](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions), following a link from [instructions on the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions-enterprise-linux-fedora-and-snap-packages).
