# Glossary
These are concepts I find especially confusing, ambiguous, or difficult to remember.

## computer science glossary

**arity** {: #aritydef }
: mass noun
: The number of [operands](#operanddef) a [subroutine](#subroutinedef) takes.[^aritydef-note1]

**associativity** {: #associativitydef }
: mass noun
: The property of an [operator](#operatordef) which determines how it is grouped with operators of the same [precedence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precedence) in the absence of parentheses.[^associativitydef-note1]

**atomicity** {: #atomicitydef }
: mass noun
: The state of a [system](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/system) (often a [database](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/database) system) in which either all stages [complete](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complete) or [none](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/none) complete.[^atomicitydef-note1]

**entry point** {: #entrypointdef }
: count noun
: The point in a program where the first instructions are executed, and where the program has access to [command line arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_arguments).[^entrypointdef-note1] [Python-Markdown has a different, unclear definition in the context of extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/#officially-supported-extensions).

**leading** {: #leadingdef }
: adjective
: Occuring at the beginning[^leadingdef] of a line.
: ⋅⋅For example, this line contains two **leading** dots.

**literal** {: #literaldef }
: count noun
: A notation for representing a fixed value in source code.[^literaldef-note1]

**nest** {: #nestdef }
: verb
: To [contain an object within a similar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity).[^nestdef-note1]
: To organize information into layers.[^nestdef-note1]

**octet** {: #octetdef }
: count noun
: A [unit of digital information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information) that consists of eight [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). The term is often used when the term [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) might be ambiguous, as the byte has historically been used for storage units of a variety of sizes.[^octetdef-note1]

**operand** {: #operanddef }
: count noun
: The part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.
: Operands have [arity](#aritydef).

**operator** {: #operatordef }
: count noun
: A construct which behaves generally like a [subroutine](#subroutinedef), but which differs [syntactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) or [semantically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) from a usual subroutine.[^operatordef-note1]
: Operators have [associativity](#associativitydef). they may be **associative, left-associative, right-associative** or **non-associative**. For **associative** operators, the operations can be grouped arbitrarily. For **left-associative** operators, the operations are grouped from the left. For **right-associative** operators, the operations are grouped from the right. For **non-associative** operators, the operations cannot be chained, often because the output type is incompatible with the input types.[^operatordef-note2]
: Hypernym of [relational operator](#relationaloperatordef).

**relational operator** {: #relationaloperatordef }
: count noun
: A [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) construct or [operator](#operatordef) that tests or defines some kind of [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)) between [two entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_function). These include numerical [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)) (*e.g.*, [5 = 5]) and [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)) (*e.g.*, [4 ≥ 3]).[^relationaloperatordef-note1]
: Hyponym of [operator](#operatordef).

**subroutine** {: #subroutinedef }
: count noun
: A sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed. It may be defined within a single program, or separately in a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)) that can be used by many programs. In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a **procedure**, a **function**, a **routine**, a [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computing)), or a **subprogram**. The generic term **callable unit** is sometimes used.[^subroutinedef1] [^subroutinedef-note1]

**trailing** {: #trailingdef }
: adjective
: Occuring at the end[^trailingdef] of a line.
: For example, this line contains two **trailing** dots.⋅⋅

**truncate** {: #truncatedef }
: verb
: To shorten a [decimal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decimal) [number](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/number) by removing [trailing](#trailingdef) or [leading](#leadingdef) [digits](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/digit).[^truncatedef-note1]
