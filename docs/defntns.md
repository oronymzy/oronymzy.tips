# Definitions
These are concepts I find especially confusing, ambiguous, or difficult to remember.

**entry point** {: #entrypointdef }
: count noun
: [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entry_point&oldid=871836841) is <q>where the first instructions in a computer program are executed, and where the program then processes command line arguments, which in most common operating systems, are usually set after the file path to the program in the command shell</q>. [Python-Markdown has a different, unclear definition in the context of extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/#officially-supported-extensions).

**leading** {: #leadingdef }
: adjective
: Occuring at the beginning[^leadingdef] of a line.
: ⋅⋅For example, this line contains two **leading** dots.

**trailing** {: #trailingdef }
: adjective
: Occuring at the end[^trailingdef] of a line.
: For example, this line contains two **trailing** dots.⋅⋅
