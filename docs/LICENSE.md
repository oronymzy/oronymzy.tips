# License
Licensing varies between tips, but will always be more permissive than **[all rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved)**. If no license is indicated, [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies.

## regarding prior work
I will always make an effort to recognize prior work, regardless of licensing, and I hope others will do the same as we all [share knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing) together.
