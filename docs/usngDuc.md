# using [Duc]

Use `duc index "/foo/bar"` to create an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) of the `/foo/bar` directory's contents, then `duc gui "/foo/bar"` to view that directory's contents as a [sunburst chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart#Ring_chart,_sunburst_chart,_and_multilevel_pie_chart), or `duc ui "/foo/bar"` to view that directory's contents using an [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) console interface.

## prior work
The scripts for creating an index of a directory and viewing that directory were introduced to me by [the “Usage” section of the Duc website](https://duc.zevv.nl/#usage).
