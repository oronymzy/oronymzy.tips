# using [Google]

!!! warning
    
    Because Google has been known to remove existing search operators[^usGoogl1], searches containing one or more search operators **could stop working at any time.**

Google supports using the asterisk (`*`) operator as a [wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character) for matching any whole word, but not for part of a word[^usGoogl2].
