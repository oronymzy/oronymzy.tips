Use `sox *.flac foobar.flac` to combine multiple FLAC files, where *foobar.flac* is the combined FLAC files.

## prior work
The method of combining multiple FLAC files was introduced to me by [an answer on Super User by Matthew Flaschen](https://superuser.com/questions/170400/join-many-mp3-ogg-and-flac-files-into-one-wav-or-flac/170401#170401).
