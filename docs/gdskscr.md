# getting a desktop screenshot
In [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), pressing ++print-screen++ will capture the entire screen,[^gdskscr1] while pressing the ++alt++ key in combination with ++print-screen++ will capture the currently selected window.[^gdskscr1] The captured image can then be [pasted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste) into an editing program such as a graphics program or even a [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor). Pressing ++print-screen++ with both the left ++alt++ key and left ++shift++ pressed turns on a high contrast mode (this [keyboard shortcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut) can be turned off by the user).[^gdskscr2] Since Windows 8, pressing the ++win++ key in combination with ++print-screen++ (and optionally in addition to the ++alt++ key) will save the captured image to disk (the default pictures location).[^gdskscr3] This behavior is therefore backward compatible with users who learned Print Screen actions under [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) such as [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).
