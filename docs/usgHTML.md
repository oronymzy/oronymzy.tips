# using [HTML]
## [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
The smallest syntactically valid HTML5 document seems to be `<!doctype html><title>a</title>`, where *a* is any non-[space](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#inter-element-white-space) character.

## prior work
The requirements for the smallest syntactically valid HTML 5 document was introduced to me by [a comment on Stack Overflow by Smi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9797046/whats-a-valid-html5-document/26304776#26304776).
