# making a file executable

!!! warning "Security risk"
    
    Take care to only use executable files from reputable sources.

In Kubuntu, use `chmod +x foo.bar`, where *foo.bar* is the file to be made executable or, alternatively, use ++"Context Menu > Properties > Permissions > Is executable"++. To run the program, use `./foo.bar`, where *foo.bar* is the file that has been made executable.
