# getting [filesystem] information

Use `df -T` to display filesystem types for [mounted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing)) storage devices.

## explanation
The `-T` [option](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/df-invocation.html) prints filesystem types.

## prior work
The [df](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Df_(Unix)) script was introduced to me by [an answer on Ask Ubuntu by Kevin Bowen](https://askubuntu.com/questions/309047/how-do-i-find-out-what-filesystem-my-partitions-are-using/309094#309094).
