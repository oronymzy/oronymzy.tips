# using [GNU GRUB]
To access the GRUB command line during boot on an [Ubuntu-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Ubuntu-based) system, press and hold ++shift++ if booting from BIOS, or press and hold ++esc++ if booting from UEFI.

## prior work
The method of accessing the GNU command line was introduced to me by [an answer on Ask Ubuntu by Vojtech Trefny](https://askubuntu.com/questions/16042/how-to-get-to-the-grub-menu-at-boot-time/16049#16049).
