## synthesizing speech as audio output

!!! note
    
    - {==Foo bar? Baz.==} represents text to be synthesized as speech.

Use `echo "Foo bar? Baz." | festival --tts` to produce synthesized English speech as [audio output](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_23.html). The [Festival Speech Synthesis System] provides [multiple possible voices](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_24.html#SEC98).

It is also possible to [synthesize speech from a text file](cnvffmt.md#plaintexttossFLAC).
