# searching a [Git] repository

## searching for Git commits applied to a single file

!!! note
    
    - {==foobar.baz==} represents the single file whose Git commits should be searched.

Use `git log -- foobar.baz`.

### explanation

!!! note
    
    This is an incomplete explanation.

- The `--` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---ltpathgt82308203) causes only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the path(s) following it came to be to be shown.

## searching for Git commits in which a string was added or removed

!!! note
    
    - {==foobar==} represents the string that was added or removed.

Use `git log --all --reverse --source -i -p -G "foobar"`.

### explanation

!!! note
    
    This is an incomplete explanation.

- The `-G` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--Gltregexgt) searches for patch text differences containing added or removed lines matching a string. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are supported.
- The `-i` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--i) enables case insensitivity for the `-G` search.
- The `-p` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--p) generates a patch.
- The `--reverse` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---reverse) outputs commits in reverse order.
