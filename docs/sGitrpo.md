# searching a [Git] repository

## searching for commits applied to a single file

!!! note
    
    - {==foobar.baz==} represents the single file whose commits should be searched.

Use `git log -- foobar.baz`.

### explanation

!!! note
    
    This is an incomplete explanation.

- The `--` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---ltpathgt82308203) causes only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the path(s) following it came to be to be shown.

## searching for commits in which patch text was added or removed

!!! note
    
    - {==foobar==} represents the patch text that was added or removed. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are supported.

Use `git log --all --reverse --source -i -p -G "foobar"`.

### explanation

!!! note
    
    This is an incomplete explanation.

- The `-G` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--Gltregexgt) searches for patch text differences containing added or removed lines matching a string or a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).
- The `-i` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--i) enables case insensitivity for the `-G` search.
- The `-p` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--p) generates a patch.
- The `--reverse` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---reverse) outputs commits in reverse order.

## searching for text in log messages

!!! note
    
    {==foobar==} represents the text to search for. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are supported.

Use `git log -i --grep="foobar"`.

### explanation

!!! note
    
    This is an incomplete explanation.

- The `-i` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt--i) enables case insensitivity for the `--grep` search.
- The `--grep` [option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---grepltpatterngt) searches for log messages matching a string or a regular expression.
