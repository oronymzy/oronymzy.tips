# using [Atom text editor]

Autocomplete suggestions can be disabled by unchecking `Show Suggestions On Keystroke` in the the [autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus) core package, or by disabling the package entirely.

## plugins

[atom-mermaid](https://atom.io/packages/atom-mermaid)
: Preview diagrams and flowcharts by mermaid library.

[emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)

[Highlight Selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected)
: Highlight occurrences of a selection within the open editor. Can be triggered by either double clicking a word, or selecting a word/text with your cursor.

[Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen)
: An interactive coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and [other Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).
: To install Hydrogen, use `apm install hydrogen`.
: To enable Python support in Hydrogen, use `sudo python -m pip install ipykernel && sudo python -m ipykernel install --user`.

[Markdown Preview Plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)
: A fork of [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) that provides a real-time preview of Markdown documents.

[Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
: A scaled-down preview of the full document that also functions as a scrollbar.

[minimap-highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected)

[simple-drag-drop-text](https://atom.io/packages/simple-drag-drop-text)

You may change the modifier key in the Settings; options are ++ctrl++, ++alt++, and ++meta++ (super/Windows/command).

[wordcount](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount)
: Counts the words and characters in the current document and displays them in the status bar.

## prior work
- The bulk of the installation script for enabling Python support in Hydrogen was introduced to me [The Kernels section of the Installation page in the Hydrogen documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html##kernels) and [the Kernels page on nteract](https://nteract.io/kernels).
- The method of installing the Hydrogen plugin was introduced to me by [the Installation page in the Hydrogen documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html).
