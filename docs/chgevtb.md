## Kubuntu
For an environment variable called `FOOBAR`, the current value can be determined with `echo $FOOBAR`, and can be changed with `export FOOBAR="barfoo"`.

## prior work
The method for determining and changing the environment variable was introduced to me by [an answer on Ask Ubuntu by Danatela](https://askubuntu.com/questions/432524/how-do-i-find-and-set-my-editor-environment-variable/432530#432530).
